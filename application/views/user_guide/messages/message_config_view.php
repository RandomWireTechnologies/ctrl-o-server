				<h1>User Guide | Message Configuration</h1>
				<p>The key concept of the flexi auth library is to give the developer a toolbox of functions that they can use to build a user authentication system matching the custom specifications required by their site.</p>
				<p>One of the ways that the library enhances the customisation of the authentication system is by allowing many of the internal library settings to be defined by the developer via the libraries config file.</p>

				<p>Define the language of status and error messages returned by flexi auth functions.</p>
				<hr/>
				
				<h6>The Language File</h6>
				<div class="frame_note">
					<p>flexi auth uses CodeIgniters language class to allow status and error messages returned by the library to be displayed in a specific language.</p>
					<p>
						To set the library to display messages in a specific language, firstly the translated language file must be added to CodeIgniters 'language' directory.
						If the language you require does not currently exist, you will need to create a copy of the default language file and get it translated.<br/>
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						To do this, copy the 'English' language file from:<br/>
						<em>'application/language/english/flexi_auth_lang.php'</em> to <em>'application/language/[YOUR LANGUAGE]/flexi_auth_lang.php'</em>.
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						It is recommended that any translations are made directly from the English language file rather than others, as that contains the originally intended messages of the library, with no lingual misinterpretations.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are unable to translate the file yourself, you could try one of the many free translators that are available online:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/">Bing Translator</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://translate.reference.com/">Dictionary.com Translator</a></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>

				<h6>Defining a Language</h6>
				<p>Defining the language used by the library is done using CodeIgniters internal methods, either via the CI config. file, or by using CI's language class.</p>
<pre>
<span class="comment">// Example #1 : Set language via CI's config file ('application/config/config.php').</span>
$config['language'] = 'spanish';
</pre>
<pre>
<span class="comment">// Example #2 : Set language via CI's language class.
// Note: This must be defined before calling the flexi auth library and would typically be done in either
// a controller or model.</span>

<span class="comment">// First load the language file.</span>
$this->lang->load('flexi_auth', 'spanish');

<span class="comment">// And then load the flexi auth library.</span>
$this->load->library('flexi_auth');
